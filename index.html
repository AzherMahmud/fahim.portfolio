            Edward Michael Grylls was born in London on 7 June 1974.[2] From a family with strong cricketing background, his grandfather Neville Ford and great-great-grandfather William Augustus Ford, were both first-class cricketers. He grew up in Donaghadee, Northern Ireland until the age of four, when his family moved to Bembridge on the Isle of Wight.[3][4]

                On 16 May 1998, Grylls achieved his childhood dream of climbing to the summit of Mount Everest in Nepal, 18 months after breaking three vertebrae in a parachuting accident.[27] At 23, he was at the time among the youngest people to have achieved this feat. There is some dispute over whether he was the youngest Briton to have done so, as he was preceded by James Allen.
