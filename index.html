            Edward Michael Grylls was born in London on 7 June 1974.[2] From a family with strong cricketing background, his grandfather Neville Ford and great-great-grandfather William Augustus Ford, were both first-class cricketers. He grew up in Donaghadee, Northern Ireland until the age of four, when his family moved to Bembridge on the Isle of Wight.[3][4]
